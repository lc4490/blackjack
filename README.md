# Leo's Casino Command Line Application

This Python script simulates a casino with a command line interface (CLI) where users can play games and manage their accounts. The application supports a blackjack game where users can place bets, draw cards, and compete against the dealer.

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `blackjack.py` script.

2. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
   python blackjack.py
   ```

3. The application will prompt you to choose whether you are a returning user or a new user.

4. Follow the prompts to create a new account or log in with an existing one.

5. Play the blackjack game by selecting the corresponding option and following the on-screen instructions.

6. The application will display your current card balance after each game and prompt you to continue playing or return to the main menu.

## Features

- Create a new user account or log in with an existing account.
- Play a simplified version of the blackjack game.
- Manage user account balances and track game outcomes.
- Data persistence: The application stores user data in a `save.txt` file, allowing you to resume using your account later.

## Note

- The script provides a basic simulation of casino games and account management. It may not have extensive error handling or advanced features.

- The script runs in the command line interface and does not have a graphical user interface (GUI).

- This application is for educational purposes and entertainment only. It does not involve real money or gambling.

This script is provided as-is and may not have full error handling or extensive testing. Use it responsibly and feel free to modify it to suit your needs.
